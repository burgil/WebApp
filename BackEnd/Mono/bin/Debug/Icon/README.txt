It's too late I'm too lazy
Figure this one out
To generate the mac file for your icon use favicon.sh
make sure to chmod +x favicon.sh
to allow execution.
to run the .mac generator type in terminal ./favicon.sh
make sure it's the same folder
to open terminal on folder quickly -> create another folder -> right click -> open terminal at folder -> cd .. -> delete useless folder (rm folderName)

^^^^^^^^^^
make sure you have a favicon.png for the generator to work
convert the favicon.png to favicon.ico using some online converter since VB.NET\CSharp (Windows) Requires an ico format aswell.

So much for being lazy :P
